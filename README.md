# Advent of Code
This is my repository of answers for the yearly Advent of Code. I have set out a goal for myself to try and solve all the challenges using C. 

Also, if I need to use any additional data structures or algorithms not provided by the standard library, I have decided that I will need to implement them myself instead of using a 3rd party library.
